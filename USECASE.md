DevNet Dashboards - Converged Availability Monitor
=====================================

The DevNet Dashboards - Converged Availability Monitor (DD-CAM) project is part of a new set of automation offers called DevNet Dashboards.  These projects are based on leading practices developed in our Network Operations Center (NOC) for our CiscoLive conference events in the US and Europe.  We plan to release modules that can be used together to enhance network observability.

This specific project provides a multi-domain, converged availability dashboard that uses Element Management Systems (EMSs) and controllers as sources of truth for device inventory.  You will not have to run a network scanning tool or utility to feed inventory for DD-CAM.

[DevNet Automation Exchange](https://developer.cisco.com/network-automation/) provides shared code repositories for gathering information from your network, performing audits, activating policy changes, or managing applications, users, or devices.
